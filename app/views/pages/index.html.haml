      %p In recent years, the Yellow Pages industry has faced scrutiny from environmentalist groups who claim printed Yellow Pages are a wasteful resource, citing statistics that nearly 70% of all Americans rarely or never use printed phone directories. The Product Stewardship Institute claims local governments spend $54 million a year to dispose of unwanted phone books and $9 million to recycle them. Phone books use low grade glues and are therefore difficult to recycle, and they often clog recycling machinery.
      %p In 2011, San Francisco became the first city in the US to restrict yellow page distribution to people who opt in, but is being sued in federal court by the Local Search Association on freedom of speech grounds. According to the Sierra Club, 1.6 million phone books were distributed annually in San Francisco, producing 3600 tons of waste, $1 million in disposal costs, and 6180 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions.
      %p In Seattle, an opt-out program reduced circulation by 100,000 copies in 17,000 households.
      %p The environmental issues faced by the print phonebook publishers has produced beneficiaries. The Internet Yellow Pages/Phonebooks have seen rapid growth in both advertising and users through the last decade. The IYP's do not face the same environmental issues, yet they remain a directional medium and ideally are locally focused.
